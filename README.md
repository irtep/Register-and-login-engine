# Register-and-login-engine

Register and login app that i made with node.js and express combo in great glitch.com. 

As got feedback i tried to make my code more consistent to be easily read.

To do:
- Might need to add some security to counter brute force attack.
- To make this more readable and easier to maintain, for example servers handlers of post is quite messy for register and login.

To use:

1. Make a folder "public" and put client.js, securityTools.js and style.css there.
2. Make a folder "views" and put all three .html files there.
3. Change in server.js your mongoDB address/username/password.
4. Might need to change server.js listening port. Works now with glitch.com with current settings.

Enjoy!
